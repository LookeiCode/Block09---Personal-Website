# Block09---Personal-Website
Block9: Personal Website Assignment

This project uses all of our HTML/CSS knowledge at the time.

I created a home page, an about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page with a working submit button.

I also made a persistent interactive header with working social media icons.

I made a simple footer with links to the other pages, along with a visual representation of how many weeks I've been in the FSA cohort.

* Home page *
The home page features a flexbox with a bunch of information about me at a glance. I also included one of my favorite quotes. Below that I included two sections with additional information about my mission and goals.

* About page *
My about page is simple. It features 3 sections of my main hobbies and interest. I used filler text here but may add legitimate information in the future.

* Portfolio page *
My portfolio page mirrors my about page, but I take a different style approach according to the example given on canvas. The difference is, is I included relevant pictures related to actual projects that I've done. I also even included a GitHub link to those projects.

* Contact page *
My contact page is super basic. It's just a form, but with a working submit button that'll take the user to another page; confirming that their email/message has been sent.
